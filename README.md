<h1 align="center"> Robot Run </h1>

Robot run is a short, challenging, single level platformer. This game was made for a third year Bachelor of IT paper at Otago Polytechnic. It is intended to be a minimum viable product to learn Godot with. At the moment I do not intend to continue development on this game but that may change at some point. If you have any interest in developing additional content for the game please get in touch!
